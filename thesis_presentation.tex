\begin{frame}{Overall goal}
  \begin{center}
    {\huge Goal: Use better numerical methods to speed up calculations.}
  \end{center}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Create new (better) numerical methods
    % obviously the main way to do this is to come up with new numerical
    % methods.
  \item Characterise cases where a given method is better/worse
    % but also, A lot of the time certain methods will be better for
    % certain situations but worse for others. We need to know when to use
    % a method as well.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Overview}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Focus on methods that use implicit midpoint rule for time discretisation.
    % IMR can conserve important properties of the model, hope
    % will give better overall accuracy + also it's stable.
  \item Find improvements to existing IMR-based methods.
  \item Characterise when it is beneficial to use IMR.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Making IMR more efficient}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Quite a few papers on IMR in micromagnetics
  \item But:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item using simple and inefficent non-linear solvers
    \item no adaptivity
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Making IMR more efficent}

  So:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Created adaptive IMR algorithm
  \item Created better solver for the discrete problem [caveat: need an
    effective preconditioner for LLG block].
  \end{itemize}
  % these are the main contributions of my thesis

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{When do we need implicit (stable) methods?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Little research about when implicit methods are needed in micromagnetics
  \item Some papers say that implicit methods are much more efficient, but others use explicit methods without complaints
  \item Some mixed ideas about where stiffness comes from
    % (precession vs damping timescales? exchange vs magnetostatics propogation
    % timescales?
    % discretisation?) (not in publications but my impression from talking
    % to people)
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Do we need implicit methods }

  So:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Studied origins of stiffness in micromagnetics.
  \item You can explain observed stiffness with discretisation
    alone.
  \item Characterised discretisation lengths where stiffness occurs (for
    FEM and FEM/BEM methods).
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{How useful is geometric integration?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Plenty of papers on geometric integration methods for micromagnetics
  \item GI said to be very useful in other areas
  \item Plenty of claims that GI is important
  \item But little numerical evidence! (\ie comparisons of errors)
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How useful is geometric integration?}

  So:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Experimented with a IMR, trapezoid rule and BDF2 for two problems with
    analytical solutions.
  \item Found TR and IMR perform similarly, but BDF2 is quite a bit worse.
  \item However, TR seems to be very close to having the geometric
    integration properties of IMR.
    % Both non-dissipative, for sufficiently simple cases they are the same
    % method, maybe TR with another method of conserving |m| would be GI?
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Created adaptive IMR method
  \item Created efficient solver
  \item Characterised when stiffness is an issue in FEM/BEM simulations
  \item No strong conclusions possible on overall usefulness of GI
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
